## Hi there, I'm Luke 👋

Well, my real name is Lucas Romero Di Benedetto and I'm a UI Dev 👨‍💻 and Design lover ❤️. I really like programing and challenges, listen music and play my favorite videogames. I want to be a better dev every day, learning tech and soft skills. I like working with people and build cool products together as a team. I enjoy finding patterns and build systems based on it. I'm an organized person at work. I like to document my work to make the way more easy to others 🤗

### I'm currently working on

As a developer at Aerolab 🎈 i'm currently working on mobile apps and huge websites for fintech and banks. I really enjoy team challenges.

### I'm currently learning

I try to learning every day things from internet, teammates, managers and friends. But, I want focusing my learning on performance, soft skills, and deep/core language behaviors. Maybe AI in a near future.

### I worked at

#### Aerolab ❤️

Currently working at Aero. A nice place to work with passionate people, devs, designers and PM. The culture here is amazing, I learned a lot of things about personal and professional growth. I try to do my best when work as a team leader and I really enjoy it. I learned a lot about manage stuff with clients, understanding the business, manage teams, motivate teammates to reach the best, work with PMs and help they setting roadmaps, deadlines or tech support. Aero gave me the opportunity to be a mentor. What to say about that? I love it and I love my mentees, they are rough gems.
Talking about tech challenges, I learned the best from the best people in Aero. Here we work with modern tech. And of course I love working side to side with designers.

#### Globant 🏢

I was work here for about 1 year. It was the "corpo experience". I think any dev needs to work on a corpo or software factory at least once. I learn a lot of things about bourocracy, project proccess, issue management, code-test challenges. I knew a lot of professionals, made some friends. In a place like Globant yo are a developer focusing in tasks. Here I have understood what kind of developer I would not want to be (at least for now)

#### 3818 👶

The place that saw me grow. I worked here for about 3 years, all was new for me, joining the team with 0 skills. I was understanding the beauty of programming. I learned a lot of things about UI, client briefs, project management things and of course be member of a great small team. With 3 years of work I learned more than college classes.

### My learning path 🎓

Well I used to be an industrial designer some time ago. But I loved the digital world and luckily I found my passion in programming. Maybe what I liked was to build products, now I have the opportunity to be digital and be in many places at the same time instantly.
