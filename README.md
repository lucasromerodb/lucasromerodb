## Hi there, I'm Luke üëã

> I used to be an industrial designer some time ago. But I loved the digital world and luckily I found my passion in programming. Maybe what I liked was to build products, now I have the opportunity to be digital and be in many places at the same time instantly.

My real name is Lucas but just call me Luke. Besides programming, my other two passions are making 3D Art or drawings and play video-games (I'm a The Legend of Zelda fan). What about my job? I love to exchange knowledge and experience with others and find a way to motivate teams. That's why I'm a member of a mentorship program at Aerolab. Improve development process are really important for me, combining this interests and skills I feel responsible to write documentations, proposing conventions or setting code-quality recommendations and make the way more easy to others every time I have the opportunity ü§ó

## My career path

Currently working at Aero. A nice place to work with passionate people, devs, designers and PMs. The culture here is amazing, I learned a lot of things about personal and professional growth. I try to do my best when work as a team leader and I really enjoy it. I learned a lot about manage stuff with clients, understanding the business, manage teams, motivate teammates to reach the best, work with PMs and help they setting roadmaps, deadlines or tech support. Aero gave me the opportunity to be a mentor. What to say about that? I love it and I love my mentees, they are rough gems ‚ú®. Talking about tech challenges, I learned a lot from the first day ir Aerolab, they are always ready to help. Here we work with modern tech. And of course I love working side to side with designers.
