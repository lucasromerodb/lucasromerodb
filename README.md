## Hi there, I'm Luke üëã

Well my real name is Lucas Romero Di Benedetto but... just call me Luke. In my past I was an industrial designer but nowadays I make money working as a developer and I love it. My other two passions are making some 3D Art or drawings and play videogames. Love exchange knowledge and experience with oters as a way to motivate teams. Write documentation is important to me that's why I feel responsible to write it and make the way more easy to others every time I have the opportunity ü§ó

### Currently working on

As a developer at Aerolab üéà I'm currently working on mobile apps and huge websites with an scalable component system. Also I'm a member of the mentoring program and process improvements for te whole developer team. As a circumstancial task currently I'm participating on the dev hiring process with my manager.

### Learning

Internet are massive, there a lot of things to learn. Of course also I learn every day from my teammates, managers and friends, but I want focusing my learning on performance, soft skills, project architectures and deep/core language behaviors. Maybe AI in a future.

### My career path

#### Aerolab ‚ù§Ô∏è

Currently working at Aero. A nice place to work with passionate people, devs, designers and PMs. The culture here is amazing, I learned a lot of things about personal and professional growth. I try to do my best when work as a team leader and I really enjoy it. I learned a lot about manage stuff with clients, understanding the business, manage teams, motivate teammates to reach the best, work with PMs and help they setting roadmaps, deadlines or tech support. Aero gave me the opportunity to be a mentor. What to say about that? I love it and I love my mentees, they are rough gems ‚ú®. Talking about tech challenges, I learned a lot from the first day ir Aerolab, they are always ready to help. Here we work with modern tech. And of course I love working side to side with designers.

#### Globant üè¢

I was work here for about 1 year. It was the "corpo experience". I think any dev needs to work on a corpo or software factory at least once. I learn a lot of things about bourocracy, project proccess, issue management, code-test challenges. I knew a lot of professionals, made some friends. In a place like Globant yo are a developer focusing in tasks. Here I have understood what kind of developer I would not want to be (at least for now)

#### 3818 üë∂

The place that saw me grow. I worked here for about 3 years, all was new for me, joining the team with 0 skills. I was understanding the beauty of programming. I learned a lot of things about UI, client briefs, project management things and of course be member of a great small team. With 3 years of work I learned more than college classes.

### My learning path üéì

Well I used to be an industrial designer some time ago. But I loved the digital world and luckily I found my passion in programming. Maybe what I liked was to build products, now I have the opportunity to be digital and be in many places at the same time instantly.
